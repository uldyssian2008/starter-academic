I am a fortunate Ph.D. student advised by [Prof. Eva. L. Dyer](https://dyerlab.gatech.edu/people/pi-profile/) in [NerDS Lab](https://dyerlab.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech. Before that, I received M.A. from Statistics at Columbia University in 2016 and both M.S. & B.S. from ECE at National Taiwan University (NTU) in 2013 and 2011, respectively.

I am interested in general mathematic solutions to machine learning problems. My past research experiences include **Bayesian Optimization**, **Deep learning theory**, and **Optimal transport**.
